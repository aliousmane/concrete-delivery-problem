    "In this paper, we propose a more realistic method for calculating travel times based on real travel distances obtained from Google Maps API. The accurate travel time information is used as input for the RMCDP, to provide results that  are more convincing. This paper compares  RMCDP with two different objective functions; (i) spatial distance and (ii) real distance. This research will clarify the influence that the quality of this information has on the decision-making process and whether it is relevant to regard the accurate travel time to achieve a more realistic result\n"

    "- Several deliveries may be scheduled in a row in order to completely satisfy the order of a single customer.\n",

    "-  All single deliveries should take place just in time. As soon as one truck has finished its unloading operation, preferably the next truck should already be available and ready to start its unloading operation. Gaps between consecutive unloading operations constitute a trouble for the constructor, therefore they should be avoided to the best extent possible. Unloading operations are supposed to be non-overlapping, hence only one truck can unload at a time. \n",
