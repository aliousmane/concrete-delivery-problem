The temporal constraints allow for imposing pairwise synchronization and pairwise temporal precedence between customer visits, independently of the vehicles. We describe some real world problems where in the literature the temporal constraints are usually remarkably simplified in the solution process, even though these constraints may significantly improve the solution quality and/or usefulness. We also propose an optimization based heuristic to solve real size instances. The results of numerical experiments substantiate the importance of the temporal constraints in the solution approach. We also make a computational study by comparing a direct use of a commercial solver against the proposed heuristic, where the latter approach can find high quality solutions within specific time limits.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with Lunch Break (VRPLB), which arises when drivers must take pauses during their shift, for example, for lunch breaks. Driver breaks have already been considered in long haul transportation when drivers must rest during their travel, but the underlying optimization problem remains difficult and few contributions can be found for less than truckload and last mile distribution contexts. This problem, which appears in the furniture delivery industry, includes rich features such as time windows and heterogeneous vehicles. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a new mathematical formulation for the VRPLB and of a fast and high performing heuristic. The mixed integer linear programming formulation has the disadvantage of roughly doubling the number of nodes, and thus significantly increasing the size of the distance matrix and the number of variables. Consequently, standard branch-and-bound algorithms are only capable of solving small-sized instances. In order to tackle large instances provided by an industrial partner, we propose a fast multi-start randomized local search heuristic tailored for the VRPLB, which is shown to be very efficient. Through a series of computational experiments, we show that solving the VRPLB without explicitly considering the pauses during the optimization process can lead to a number of infeasibilities. These results demonstrate the importance of integrating drivers pauses in the resolution process.}

  abstract = {In the vehicle routing literature it is generally assumed that each vehicle is driven by a single driver from the beginning to the end of its route. We introduce a new vehicle routing problem without this assumption. We consider a problem with two depots in which vehicles must departure from one depot and arrive to the other, while drivers should leave and return to the same depot and their routes can not exceed a given duration. Under these conditions, changes of vehicle are mandatory for the drivers in order to go back to their base depots. These changes can only take place at some particular nodes. Moreover, vehicles and drivers must be synchronized. We model the problem as a vehicle routing problem with two depots and two types of routes, one for drivers and the other for vehicles. We propose a mixed integer programming formulation for the problem and design a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve it. Computational results show that the proposed approach can find optimal solutions for instances with up to 30 nodes.}

These problems exhibit, in addition to the usual task covering constraints, further synchronization requirements between the vehicles, concerning spatial, temporal, and load aspects. They constitute an emerging field in vehicle routing research and are becoming a “hot” topic. The contribution of the paper is threefold: (i) It presents a classification of different types of synchronization. (ii) It discusses the central issues related to the exact and heuristic solution of such problems. (iii) It comprehensively reviews pertinent literature with respect to applications as well as successful solution approaches, and it identifies promising algorithmic avenues. }

The demands of the customers are typically larger than the capacity of the vehicles which means that most customers are visited several times. This is a split delivery vehicle routing problem with additional constraints. We first propose a two phase solution method that assigns deliveries to the vehicles, and then builds vehicle routes. Both subproblems are formulated as integer linear programming problems. We then show how to combine the two phases in a single integer linear program. Experiments on real life instances are performed to compare the performance of the two solution methods.},

  abstract = {In the context of home healthcare services, patients may need to be visited multiple times by different healthcare specialists who may use a fleet of heterogeneous vehicles. In addition, some of these visits may need to be synchronized with each other for performing a treatment at the same time. We call this problem the Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Synchronized visits (HF-VRPS). It consists of planning a set of routes for a set of light duty vehicles running on alternative fuels. We propose three population-based hybrid Artificial Bee Colony metaheuristic algorithms for the HF-VRPS. These algorithms are tested on newly generated instances and on a set of homogeneous VRPS instances from the literature. Besides producing quality solutions, our experimental results illustrate the trade-offs between important factors, such as CO2 emissions and driver wage. The computational results also demonstrate the advantages of adopting a heterogeneous fleet rather than a homogeneous one for the use in home healthcare services.}

A request is composed of several pickups of different items, followed by a single delivery at the client location. We formally describe, model and solve this rich and new problem in the field of pickup and delivery vehicle routing. We solve the problem exactly via branch-and-bound and heuristically developing a hybrid adaptive large neighborhood search with improvement operations. Several new removal and insertion operators are developed to tackle the special precedence constraints, which can be used in other pickup and delivery problems. Computational results are reported on different types of instances to study the performance of the developed algorithms, highlighting the performance of our heuristic compared to the exact method, and assessing its sensibility to different parameter settings.}

This complexity is mostly associated to the task of optimally exploring a highly constrained solution space. This paper addresses the problem of designing a set of vehicle routes satisfying the delivery and the collection requirements of a set of geographically scattered linehaul and backhaul customers. Each customer has a known demand for delivery and/or pickup, and it must be serviced within a predefined time window, representing the earliest and the latest times service time, by a vehicle of a heterogeneous fleet of depot-returning capacitated vehicles. Additionally the proposed model, aiming at minimizing the logistics costs, also takes manufacturing capacities and driving hour's regulations into consideration. The proposed algorithm was embedded in a native application. This digital tool, enabling the support of a holistic production and logistics planning, was implemented in a food company.}

  abstract = {In real life distribution of goods, relatively long service times may make it difficult to serve all requests during regular working hours. These difficulties are even greater if the beginning of the service in each demand site must occur within a time window and violations of routing time restrictions are particularly undesirable. We address this situation by considering a variant of the vehicle routing problem with time windows for which, besides routing and scheduling decisions, a number of extra deliverymen can be assigned to each route in order to reduce service times. This problem appears, for example, in the distribution of beverage and tobacco in highly dense Brazilian urban areas. We present a mathematical programming formulation for the problem, as well as a tabu search and an ant colony optimization heuristics for obtaining minimum cost routes. The performance of the model and the heuristic approaches are evaluated using instances generated from a set of classic examples from the literature.}

  abstract = { The pickup and delivery problem with time windows is the problem of serving a number of transportation requests using a limited amount of vehicles. Each request involves moving a number of goods from a pickup location to a delivery location. Our task is to construct routes that visit all locations such that corresponding pickups and deliveries are placed on the same route, and such that a pickup is performed before the corresponding delivery. The routes must also satisfy time window and capacity constraints. This paper presents a heuristic for the problem based on an extension of the large neighborhood search heuristic previously suggested for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The proposed heuristic is composed of a number of competing subheuristics that are used with a frequency corresponding to their historic performance. This general framework is denoted adaptive large neighborhood search. The heuristic is tested on more than 350 benchmark instances with up to 500 requests. It is able to improve the best known solutions from the literature for more than 50\% of the problems. The computational experiments indicate that it is advantageous to use several competing subheuristics instead of just one. We believe that the proposed heuristic is very robust and is able to adapt to various instance characteristics. }

Given the intrinsic difficulty of this problem class, approximation methods seem to offer the most promise for practical size problems. After describing a variety of heuristics, we conduct an extensive computational study of their performance. The problem set includes routing and scheduling environments that differ in terms of the type of data used to generate the problems, the percentage of customers with time windows, their tightness and positioning, and the scheduling horizon. We found that several heuristics performed well in different problem environments; in particular an insertion-type heuristic consistently gave very good results. }

  abstract = {Along with the concerns about global climate change, more and more researchers pay attention to the low carbon logistics. Since the logistics industry is an important source of carbon emissions, it is becoming more and more important to reduce carbon emissions in logistics operation. In this paper, we study a low carbon for location routing problem with heterogeneous fleet, simultaneous pickup-delivery and time windows and design a two-phased hybrid heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. Firstly, we introduce the concept of temporal-spatial distance and use genetic algorithm to cluster the customer points to construct the initial path. Then, we use variable neighborhood search algorithm for local search. By incorporating the idea of simulated annealing algorithm into the framework of variable neighborhood algorithm, the global optimization ability of the algorithm is improved. At the same time, the vehicle adjustment strategy is added in the optimization process. The computational experiments are implemented to investigate the performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm. Computational results show that the initial solution considering temporal-spatial distance has obvious advantages in the efficiency of the algorithm and the quality of the solution.}
