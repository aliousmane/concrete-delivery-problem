The demands of the customers are typically larger than the capacity of the vehicles which means that most customers are visited several times. This is a split delivery vehicle routing problem with additional constraints. We first propose a two phase solution method that assigns deliveries to the vehicles, and then builds vehicle routes. Both subproblems are formulated as integer linear programming problems. We then show how to combine the two phases in a single integer linear program. Experiments on real life instances are performed to compare the performance of the two solution methods.},
