    "    - Synchronization in vehicle routing — a survey of VRPs with multiple synchronization constraints, Drexl 2012\n",
    "Schmid et al.  consider the **problem of concrete delivery** from **several plants to construction sites** by **heterogeneous vehicles**. The demand at each site exceeds the capacity of the largest vehicle, so **several deliveries are necessary to fulfil a task**. Only one vehicle at a time can deliver concrete at a site. Moreover, it is necessary that the flow of concrete at a site, once started, be almost uninterrupted. This means that **when a vehicle delivering to a site is finished, the next one should already be present**. In addition, a vehicle can only load concrete for one site at a time, so it always delivers its complete load on each visit to a site and then returns to a plant to reload. **The loading and unloading times are independent of the amount loaded or unloaded**.\n",
    "Finally, there are support vehicles needed at some sites to assist in unloading. These vehicles must be present at the site during the complete delivery process and hence must be the first ones to arrive and the last ones to leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors develop an **MIP model using five types of binary and three types of continuous time variable**. **Lower and upper bounds for the number of deliveries** to a site are computed. These determine the number of variables. The most important binary variables are (i) **  $x^k_{i_1n_1i_2n_2}$ equalling one iff vehicle $k$ performs delivery $n_2$ at construction site $i_2$ directly after performing delivery $n_1$ at site $i_1$**, (ii) ** $y^k_{in}$ equalling one iff vehicle k performs delivery n at site i **, and (iii) ** $z_{in}$ equalling one iff the $nth$ delivery at site i is performed at all**. The two most important time variables are **$t^{start}_{in}$ and $t^{end}_{in}$, indicating the start and end of the $nth$ delivery to site i respectively**. Operation synchronization is ensured by constraint types stating that (i) **the time between two consecutive unloading operations assigned to a vehicle is big enough to allow the vehicle to drive to the closest plant and reload there (this ensures that no two vehicles can unload at a site at the same time and that $t^{start}_{in} − t^{end}_{in-1} \\geq 0 $ for all i and n)** and (ii) **the time between the beginning and the end of an unloading operation, that is, $t^{start}_{in} − t^{end}_{in}$, equals the unloading time of the vehicle performing the nth delivery at i**. **The requirement that the flow of concrete at a site, once started, be uninterrupted, is modelled as a soft constraint: The objective function contains a penalty term $c^{penalty}(t^{start}_{in} − t^{end}_{in-1})$  for each site i and each delivery n > 1 **. This can be called soft exact deferred operation synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load synchronization is ensured by a constraint type requiring that the sum of the capacities of the vehicles that have delivered to a site be greater than or equal to the site’s demand\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors solve the problem by variable neighbourhood search (VNS) and very large neighbourhood search (VLNS) (Ahuja et al.). **An initial solution is created by generating a delivery sequence for each task, ensuring feasibility regarding task fulfilment, considering the tasks one by one.** \n",
    "\n",
    "VNS is then performed on the resulting set of sequences. There is a shaking and an iterative improvement phase. The neighbourhoods used in the shaking phase basically replace a vehicle in a sequence by another vehicle. To evaluate the solution, a schedule for all vehicles is computed by **forward and backward termination** inspired by the critical path method used in project management. Forward termination schedules every delivery as early as possible, taking into account vehicle availability. The result serves as input for backward termination, where every delivery is scheduled as late as possible. Unfortunately, the authors do not give full details\n",
    "on this ingenious idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the improvement phase, three local search operators are used. The first one tries to remove unnecessary vehicles from a sequence, the second one moves vehicles within one sequence, and the third one swaps vehicles between different sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of the VLNS approach is to use the MIP model where all variables are fixed according to a feasible solution obtained by VNS. In each VLNS step, some of the variables are unfixed, and the resulting MIP is solved by a commercial solver, using several additional cuts. The decision which variables to unfix is based on a hierarchical ranking of the variable types.\n",
    "The decision whether or not to execute a certain delivery, represented by the $z_{in}$ variables, is at the top level of this hierarchy. The variables determining which vehicle to use for a certain delivery, $y^k_{in}$, constitute the second level. Most variables of these two types remain fixed in the VLNS step. All other variables are unfixed.\n",
    "The authors solve a set of real-world test instances and obtain very good solutions\n",

    "In Schmid et al. (2010), a rich VRP for the delivery of ready-mixed concrete is studied. The authors propose a VNS and a very large neighborhood search (VLNS) where a MILP model is solved at each iteration which improves the current solution. To reduce the computational time, some variables are fixed in the MILP model. The number and the set of variables to be fixed are determined by the neighborhood definition."
